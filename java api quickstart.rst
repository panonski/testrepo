SevenBridges Java client for public API Quickstart
==================================================

This guide walks you through everything you need to get started with the Seven Bridges API Java client.

Authentication and Configuration
================================
To start, you need to authenticate with the API by passing your authentication token and the API endpoint you will be interacting with.

You can find your authentication token on the respective pages:
https://igor.sbgenomics.com/developers for the Seven Bridges Platform
https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/developers for the CGC

The API endpoints for each environment are:
https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2 for the Seven Bridges Platform
https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2 for the CGC.

For more information about the API, including details of the available parameters for each API call, you should check the API documentation before using this library:
http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api for the Seven Bridges Platform.
http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/the-cgc-api for the CGC.

Once you have obtained your authentication token from one of the URLs listed above, you can use the ClientBuilder class to initialize the API client::

 ClientBuilder builder = Clients.builder();

If you do not pass any other parameters, the builder will automatically attempt to find your API key values in a number of default/conventional locations and then use the discovered values.
The following locations will be each be checked in the following order:

1. The classpath of the java application which uses this client library.

2. Environment variables SB_API_ENDPOINT and SB_AUTH_TOKEN.

3. Common configuration file with the defined parameters:

It is located at: Linux, Mac OS X: **$HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials**

MS Windows: **%UserProfile%\.sevenbridges\\credentials**

This is a special credentials file that may be shared with other Seven Bridges client applications, so you should specify only these two keys in it (if any). If you have more than one profile, you can store the information for each profile in it.  For example::

  [default]
  auth_token = 7eab0822exAMPle23d7d14c2eEXampLE
  api_url = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2

  [my_other_profile]
  auth_token = 1e43fEXampLEa5523dfd14exAMPle3e5
  api_url = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2

4. Library-specific configuration file **sevenbridges.properties** which contains the same keys as above, located at:

Linux, Mac OS X: **$HOME/.sevenbridges/sevenbridges-java/**
MS Windows: **%UserProfile%/.sevenbridges/sevenbridges-java/**

If the above-mentioned methods do not satisfy your needs, you can also specify your credentials explicitly when you build a client::

  static Client initClient() {
    ClientBuilder builder = Clients.builder();
    builder.setBaseUrl("https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2");
    builder.setAuthenticationScheme(AuthenticationScheme.AUTH_TOKEN);
    builder.setApiKey(ApiKeys.builder()
      .setSecret("39bexAMPle2742338EXampLEe3dde8a7")
      .build());
      return builder.build();
  }

**NOTE: Keep your authentication token safe! It encodes all your credentials on the Platform or CGC. Generally, we recommend storing the token in a configuration file, which will then be stored in your home folder rather than in the code itself. This prevents the authentication token from being committed to source code repositories.**

After the credentials are loaded, you can use a helper method to initialize the client and obtain the User object which holds your user information, such as your name and contact details::

  Client client = initClient();
  User user = client.getCurrentUser();

To obtain your details simply use the appropriate get() method. For email address, it would be::

  user.getEmail();

For convenience, some code samples contain logging commands. To use logging, invoke a Logger instance and pass the current class as a parameter::

  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ThisClass.class);

Managing projects
=================
Projects are the core building blocks of our Platform. All the analyses you design and run take place inside a project. Here are some basic methods for dealing with them.

If you are not familiar with the project structure of the Seven Bridges Platform and CGC, take a look at their respective documentation: `projects on the CGC <http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/projects-on-the-cgc>`_ and `projects on the Seven Bridges Platform <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/projects-on-the-platform>`_.

To list all the projects that you are a member of, call::

 ProjectList projects = user.getProjects();

You can then iterate through the list of projects and get their information, including names and IDs. A project is referenced through its ID, so you will need to know it in order to work with your project further::

  Iterator<Project> projectIterator = projects.iterator();
  log.info("Project names: ");
  while (projectIterator.hasNext()) {
    Project currentProject = projectIterator.next();
    log.info(" name: {} - id: {}",
    currentProject.getName(),
    currentProject.getId());
  }

The ID for a project consists of your username and the project's name, e.g. ``my-username/the-first-project``::

 wantedProject = user.getProjectById(String.format("%s/my-best-project", myUsername));

Each project also has a name, a description string indicating its use, a type, some tags, a ``billing_group`` identifier representing the billing group that is attached to the project and the href. The property ``href`` is a URL on the server that uniquely identifies the resource in question. All resources have this attribute. Each of the above attributes can be obtained using the relevant get method.

To create a new project, you need to provide its name and the billing group ID.

The billing group ID designates which funding resource to charge for the analyses you run in the project you're about to create. Learn more about `billing groups <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/payments#section-billing-groups>`_.
::
 BillingGroupList billingGroups = user.getBillingGroups();
 firstBillingGroup = billingGroups.iterator().next().getId();

Now you can create a new project. Remember that the project will be assigned an ID which consists of your username and the projectâ€™s shortname, which is created from the name you gave it through ``setName()`` (e.g. ``rfranklin/new-test-project``).  The human readable name you set can be changed afterwards, but the project ID remains unchanged throughout the life of the project.
::
    Project newProject = client.instantiate(Project.class);
    newProject.setName("New test project")
        .setDescription("This is a project created through V2 API")
        .setBillingGroupId(user.getBillingGroups().iterator().next().getId());
    log.info("Created new project with name '{}' and project id '{}'", newProject.getName(), newProject.getId());


Managing project members
========================

Sometimes it can feel lonely to be the only person in the project. You can add other users as members of your projects and assign them permissions as necessary. You will need to know their usernames on the platform.

The read permission is assigned by default to each project member and cannot be stripped. Other permissions are modifiable. Learn more about permissions.

First we instantiate a new project member and then provide the username of the person we want to add and set the necessary permissions. After that we add the user to the desired project::

  Member newMember = client.instantiate(Member.class);
  newMember
    // must be an existing user!
    .setUsername("annemarie.jones")
    .setPermissions(Members.getDefaultPermissions());
  currentProject.addMember(newMember);

If you need to remind yourself of who has which permissions on your project, you can iterate through the list of the project members::

  MemberList members = currentProject.getMembers();
  Iterator<Member> memberIterator = members.iterator();
  System.out.println("Members of the project " + currentProject.getId());
  while (memberIterator.hasNext()) {
    Member currMember = memberIterator.next();
    log.info(" Username : {} Permissions : {}",
    currMember.getUsername(),
    currMember.getPermissions());
  }

Sometimes, you might want to change permissions of a certain member. Let's give our user the right to modify (the ``write`` permission) and download (the ``copy`` permission) files from our common project::

  Map<String, Boolean> permissions = newMember.getPermissions();
  permissions.put("write", true);
  permissions.put("copy", true);
  newMember.setPermissions(permissions);
  newMember.save();

Now, if you want to see the updated list of members and permissions, remember to reload it::

  members.reload();
  for (Member member : members) {
    log.info(" Username : {} Permissions : {}", member.getUsername(),
    member.getPermissions());
  }

Finally, once your collaboration comes to an end, you can easily remove the member from the project::

  currentProject.removeMember(newMember.getUsername());

Managing files on the Platform
==============================

Files are an integral part of each analysis. Before you can analyze data on the Seven Bridges Platform, the files need to be within a specific project. You can either use the files that are already publicly available on the Platform or upload your own.

You can check what files are currently in your project by iterating through a list of files::

  Project myProject = user.getProjectById(String.format("%s/source-project", user.getUsername()));
  log.info("In project {} there are {} files", myProject.getName(), myProject.getFiles().getSize());
  FileList filesInMyProject = myProject.getFiles();
  for (File file : filesInMyProject) {
    log.info(" File {} with name {} and size {}B", file.getId(), file.getName(), file.getSize());
  }


If you are starting from an empty project, one way to get going is to copy some of the public files into your project. You can utilize the file tags to find the files you need. The tags are keywords or strings that make it easier to identify and organize files youâ€™ve imported from public datasets.

Learn more about `public files <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/file-repositories>`_ or `tagging your files <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/tag-your-files>`_.

Letâ€™s say you want to copy all the files that are related to human genome version 19. They will be tagged with the ``hg19`` tag::

  Project destinationProject = user.getProjectById(String.format("%s/destination-project", user.getUsername()));
  log.info(" There are {} files in destination project before copy", destinationProject.getFiles().getSize());
  log.info(" There are {} files in destination project before copy", destinationProject.getFiles().getSize());
  FileList publicFiles = user.getPublicFiles(Files.criteria().withTag("hg19"));
  for (File file : publicFiles) {
    file.copy(destinationProject, file.getName() + "_copy");
  }
  log.info(" There are {} files in destination project after copy", destinationProject.getFiles().getSize());


Tags can be applied to mark files in any way you find useful. Letâ€™s say you decided you will not use files from a certain project anymore, but do not want to delete them until someone else has checked out your project. You can then use tags to mark the files as ready for deletion.

  FileList destinationFiles = destinationProject.getFiles();
  Iterator<File> iterator = destinationFiles.iterator();
  while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    File next = iterator.next();
    next.setTags(Collections.singleton("for_deletion"));
    next.save();
  }

All files have associated metadata which makes them searchable, keeping your file collection manageable as it grows. It also enables you group files properly for analyses.

Learn more about `metadata <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/metadata-on-the-seven-bridges-platform>`_.

When you need to change metadata on a file, you should first obtain the file's ID. Then you can either patch the file metadata (adding new and-or changing existing metadata fields) or you can overwrite it (which means any metadata fields you do not explicitly reset will be deleted).

To edit metadata, use the method ``patchMetadata()``::

  File updatedFile = user.getFileById("584d6f2160b2a10069e40d5d");
  Map<String, String> metaPatch = new HashMap<>();
  metaPatch.put("paired_end", "1");
  metaPatch.put("batch_number", "3");
  updatedFile.patchMetadata(metaPatch);
  // save the changes you made!
  updatedFile.save();

To overwrite metadata, use the method ``setMetadata()``::

  Map<String, String> metaOver = new HashMap<>();
  metaOver.put("case_id", "CCLE-HCC1143BL");
  metaOver.put("experimental_strategy", "WGS");
  metaOver.put("investigation", "CCLE-BRCA");
  metaOver.put("paired_end", "2");
  metaOver.put("platform", "Illumina");
  metaOver.put("species", "Homo sapiens");
  updatedFile.setMetadata(metaOver);
  // save the changes you made
  updatedFile.save();

Each file also has a ``URL`` property, which gives you the URL you can use to download the file. Again, you will need to know the file ID to do this::

  File toDownload = user.getFileById("584d6f2160b2a10069e40d5d");
  String downloadUrl = toDownload.getDownloadInfo().getUrl();
  InputStream downloadStream = null;
  try {
    URL url = new URL(downloadUrl);
    downloadStream = url.openStream();
    log.info("Downloading file...");
    long bytesNum = java.nio.file.Files.copy(downloadStream,   Paths.get("local_file"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    log.info("Downloaded {} bytes", bytesNum);
  } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
    log.error("Malformed exception while creating URL from {} - error message: {}", String.valueOf(downloadUrl), e.getMessage());
  } catch (IOException e) {
    log.error("Error while downloading file {} ", e);
  } finally {
    if (downloadStream != null) {
      try {
        downloadStream.close();
      } catch (IOException skip) {
        log.warn("Error while trying to close download stream - {}", skip);
      }
    }
  }


Uploading files
===============

If you want to use your private data for analysis, you can upload them securely to the Platform.
In this section, we will see how to upload files into a project and some actions you can perform on an upload object: using an ``UploadListener`` to listen for related events, polling the number of uploaded bytes while waiting for an upload to complete, blocking further work until upload is completed, cancelling an upload and pausing and restarting an upload.

The class ``AbstractProgressListener`` contains callback methods that inform you of the state of your upload. You can implement the methods for the events you want to listen to, like in this example::

  private static class MyProgressListener extends AbstractProgressListener {

    private final AtomicInteger cnt;

    MyProgressListener(AtomicInteger cnt) {
      this.cnt = cnt;
    }

    @Override
    public void uploadFailed(Exception ex) {
      cnt.incrementAndGet();
      log.error("upload failed ", ex);
    }

    @Override
    public void uploadFinished() {
      cnt.incrementAndGet();
      log.info("upload finished ");
    }

    @Override
    public void partUploadFailed(int partNumber, int retryCnt, Exception executionException) {
      log.error("part {} failed, retry {}, exception {}", partNumber, retryCnt, executionException);
    }
 }

Then you can build a synchronized upload request using ``uploadBuilder``::

  CreateUploadRequestBuilder uploadBuilder = client.getUploadRequestBuilder();

    // block on an upload (synchronized upload)
    uploadBuilder.setName("Sync-file")
        .setFile(myPrivateFile)
        .setOverwrite(true)
        .setProject(destinationProject);

Based on this, you can create an ``UploadContext`` object which will hold information about your upload::

  List<com.sbgenomics.java.file.File> uploadedFiles = new ArrayList<>();

  UploadContext upload = user.submitUpload(uploadBuilder.build());
      try {
        com.sbgenomics.java.file.File uploadedFile = upload.getFile(); //blocking call
        uploadedFiles.add(uploadedFile);
      } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        log.error("Error while waiting for the file to be uploaded - {}", e);
      }

If you have a list of files you want to have uploaded (letâ€™s call it ``filesToUpload``), you can request upload of those files simultaneously, creating an ``UploadContext`` and ``ProgressListener`` for each file::

  static final long KB = 1024L;
  static final long MB = 1024 * KB;

  // parallel upload without blocking on get, setting up a listener for finished files
  AtomicInteger finishedCnt = new AtomicInteger(0);
  int numOfFiles = filesToUpload.size();
  List<UploadContext> uploads = new ArrayList<>(numOfFiles);
  for (int i = 0; i < numOfFiles; i++) {
    File testFile = filesToUpload(i);

    uploadBuilder.setName("File-to-upload-no-" + i)
        .setFile(testFile)
        .setOverwrite(true)
        .setProject(destinationProject)

        // if you want to cut upload in parts
        .setPartSize(64 * MB);

      UploadContext uploadContext = user.submitUpload(uploadBuilder.build(), new MyProgressListener(finishedCnt));
      uploads.add(uploadContext);
 }


When you submit an upload, a ``TransferService`` is started (if it hadnâ€™t been previously started by an earlier upload). The ``UploadContext`` objects allow you to keep track of the progress of your uploads::

  while (finishedCnt.get() < numOfFiles) {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    log.info("---------------------------------------------");
    for (UploadContext uploadContext : uploads) {
      long transferred = uploadContext.getBytesTransferred();
      long size = uploadContext.getUploadSize();
      log.info("Transferred {}% -  {} bytes out of {} for upload {}", (int)((transferred * 100)/size), transferred, size, uploadContext.getUploadName());
    }
  }

  for (UploadContext uploadContext : uploads) {
    if (uploadContext.isFinished()) {
      uploadedFiles.add(uploadContext.getFile());
    }
  }

If you want to pause an upload, you can do it through ``UploadContext.pauseTransfer()``. This will pause the current upload operation and store the information that can be used to resume the upload. The paused ``UploadContext`` object can later be passed to another ``UploadContext`` object which will resume upload from the reference point::

    uploadBuilder
        .setName("File-to-pause-and-resume")
        .setFile(testFile)
        .setOverwrite(true)
        .setProject(destinationProject)
        .setPartSize(32 * MB);
    UploadContext toPause = user.submitUpload(uploadBuilder.build());

    log.info("toPause state {}", toPause.getState());
    Thread.sleep(10_000); // let it work a while
    toPause.pauseTransfer();
    log.info("toPause state {}", toPause.getState());
    // waiting for the upload to be paused
    while (UploadState.PAUSING.equals(toPause.getState())) {
      Thread.sleep(5_000);
    }
    log.info("toPause state {}", toPause.getState());
    UploadContext resumedUpload = user.resumeUpload(toPause, testFile);
    log.info("resumedUpload state {}", resumedUpload.getState());


Trying to obtain the file from a paused upload will throw a ``PausedUploadException``. You can use this to resume the paused upload when needed.

On some occasions your app (or an external factor) might need to abort an upload. If you have instantiated an ``UploadContext`` in the above described manner, you can obtain the ID of your upload and abort it. Please keep in mind that trying to obtain the file from the ``UploadContext`` after the abort will throw an exception.
::
    String uploadId = uploadContextToBeAborted.getUploadId();
    Upload uploadById = user.getUploadById(uploadId);
    log.info("Thread {} is aborting running upload {}", Thread.currentThread().getName(), uploadId);
    uploadById.abortUpload();

Once you have uploaded all the files you needed, itâ€™s time to close the ``TransferService`` to make sure you gracefully shutdown daemon threads and release resources::

  user.shutdownTransferService();
